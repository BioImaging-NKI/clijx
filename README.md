# CLIJx is the eXperimental sibling for CLIJ2
This repository contains experimental filters based on [CLIJ](https://clij.github.io). 
Methods which turn out to be useful will become part of a future CLIJ release.

Right now, this is very preliminary. Handle all CLIJx operations with care. They may be subject to change.

## Installation intructions
Download Fiji and activate the `clij` update site as described [here](https://clij.github.io/clij-docs/installationInFiji). 
Furthermore, activate another update site `clij2`.
Update Fiji and restart it.

## CLIJx reference
The current API reference of CLIJx is available [here](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/reference). Please note that both: The CLIJx gateway and the API are under heavy construction and can change at any point. See the [release notes](https://github.com/clij/clij-advanced-filters/releases) in case one of your experimental workflows breaks.

## Code examples
Have a look in the [macros](https://github.com/clij/clijx/tree/master/src/main/macro) folder.
